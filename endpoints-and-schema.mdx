---

The Zerion API provides real-time, normalized access to onchain data through a set of RESTful endpoints. Each endpoint returns structured JSON following the [JSON:API](https://jsonapi.org/) specification, with consistent patterns for pagination, filtering, and relationships.

## Endpoint categories

### Wallets

The wallets endpoint is fundamental to building wallet applications. It provides access to:

- **Portfolio** — Aggregated wallet value across all chains and positions
- **Positions** — Individual token holdings, DeFi protocol positions, and NFTs with valuations
- **Transactions** — Full parsed transaction history with human-readable interpretations
- **Charts** — Historical portfolio value over configurable time periods

```bash
# Get a wallet's complete portfolio
curl -u "YOUR_API_KEY:" \
  "https://api.zerion.io/v1/wallets/0xd8dA.../portfolio"
```

### Fungibles

Returns metadata, pricing, and market data for fungible tokens. Supports both paginated lists and individual lookups by unique identifier.

- List and search fungible assets with filters
- Get detailed info for a specific token by ID
- Retrieve price charts over multiple time periods
- Look up tokens by chain and contract address

```bash
# Get token details by ID
curl -u "YOUR_API_KEY:" \
  "https://api.zerion.io/v1/fungibles/eth"
```

### Chains

Provides a complete list of all supported blockchains and enables lookup by chain identifier. Use this to dynamically populate chain selectors or validate chain IDs before making other API calls.

```bash
# List all supported chains
curl -u "YOUR_API_KEY:" \
  "https://api.zerion.io/v1/chains"
```

### NFTs

Access NFT data including individual tokens and collections. Requires specifying references (wallet address or collection) to scope results.

```bash
# Get NFTs for a wallet
curl -u "YOUR_API_KEY:" \
  "https://api.zerion.io/v1/wallets/0xd8dA.../nft-positions"
```

### Swap & Bridge

Get quotes and execute cross-chain swaps through a single unified interface. The API handles routing across DEXs and bridges.

### Gas

Retrieve current gas price estimates for supported chains, useful for displaying fee estimates or optimizing transaction timing.

```bash
# Get gas prices for Ethereum
curl -u "YOUR_API_KEY:" \
  "https://api.zerion.io/v1/chains/ethereum/gas-prices"
```

### DApps

Look up metadata for decentralized applications, including names, icons, and categories. DApp info appears in position and transaction data to provide context.

### Subscriptions (Webhooks)

Create and manage webhook subscriptions to receive real-time notifications when wallet transactions occur — no polling required.

```bash
# Create a transaction subscription
curl -u "YOUR_API_KEY:" \
  -X POST "https://api.zerion.io/v1/wallets/0xd8dA.../transaction-subscriptions" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"data": {"type": "transaction-subscriptions", "attributes": {"webhook_url": "https://your-app.com/webhook"}}}'
```

## Response schema

All responses follow a consistent structure:

```json
{
  "links": {
    "self": "https://api.zerion.io/v1/...",
    "next": "https://api.zerion.io/v1/...?page[after]=..."
  },
  "data": [
    {
      "type": "resource-type",
      "id": "unique-id",
      "attributes": { },
      "relationships": { }
    }
  ]
}
```

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `links` | Pagination links — `self` for the current page, `next` for the next page (if available) |
| `data` | Array of resource objects (or a single object for detail endpoints) |
| `type` | Resource type identifier (e.g., `positions`, `transactions`, `fungibles`) |
| `id` | Unique identifier for the resource |
| `attributes` | The resource's data fields |
| `relationships` | Related resources with links for fetching |

### Exploring schemas in the docs

Each endpoint in the [REST API Reference](/api-reference) section includes:

- **Interactive playground** — Send real requests and inspect responses directly in the browser
- **Response examples** — Click on response status codes (200, 400, etc.) to see example payloads
- **Schema details** — Expand any field to see its type, description, and whether it's nullable

<Tip>
Use the dropdown menus on response examples to switch between different response codes and see the full schema for each case.

## OpenAPI specification

The full API is defined in an OpenAPI 3.0.3 specification. You can use it to:

- Generate client libraries in any language
- Import into tools like Postman or Insomnia
- Power AI assistants via [MCP](/build-with-ai)

The spec is always kept in sync with the live API and powers the interactive documentation you see in the REST API Reference section.
