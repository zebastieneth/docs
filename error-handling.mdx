The Zerion API uses standard HTTP status codes and returns structured error responses. This page covers what to expect and how to handle errors gracefully.

## Error response format

All errors return a JSON object with an `errors` array:

```json
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "title": "Short error description",
      "detail": "A longer explanation of what went wrong"
    }
  ]
}
```

## HTTP status codes

| Status | Meaning | When it happens |
|--------|---------|-----------------|
| `200` | Success | Request completed successfully |
| `400` | Bad Request | Malformed parameters — check filter values, missing required fields, or invalid formats |
| `401` | Unauthorized | Missing or invalid API key |
| `404` | Not Found | The requested resource doesn't exist (single-resource endpoints only) |
| `429` | Too Many Requests | Rate limit exceeded |

### 400 — Bad Request

Returned when query parameters are malformed or invalid. Check the `detail` field for specifics.

```json
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "title": "Parameter is malformed",
      "detail": "Some validation errors will be described here"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Common causes:**
- Invalid `filter[chain_ids]` value (e.g., a chain ID that doesn't exist)
- `page[size]` outside the 1–100 range
- Missing required parameters (e.g., `filter[references]` on the NFTs endpoint)
- Malformed `filter[min_mined_at]` timestamp (must be exactly 13 digits, in milliseconds)

### 401 — Unauthorized

Returned when the API key is missing, invalid, or incorrectly encoded.

```json
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "title": "Unauthorized Error",
      "detail": "The API key is invalid, please, make sure that you are using a valid key"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Common causes:**
- Missing `Authorization` header
- API key not Base64-encoded correctly — remember to append a colon: `base64("your_key:")`
- Expired or revoked API key

<Tip>
Test your encoding: `echo -n "your_api_key:" | base64` should produce the value you pass after `Basic `.
</Tip>

### 404 — Not Found

Returned on single-resource endpoints when the ID doesn't match any record.

```json
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "title": "Resource was not found",
      "detail": "Requested resource was not found, try later"
    }
  ]
}
```

This only applies to endpoints like `/v1/fungibles/{fungible_id}` or `/v1/nfts/{nft_id}`. List endpoints return an empty `data` array instead of a 404.

### 429 — Too Many Requests

Returned when you exceed your plan's rate limit.

```json
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "title": "Too many requests",
      "detail": "Your request had been throttled"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Rate limits

Rate limits and available features depend on your plan. Visit the [dashboard](https://dashboard.zerion.io) for details on your current limits and upgrade options.

### Handling rate limits

When you receive a `429` response, back off and retry after a delay:

<CodeGroup>

```javascript JavaScript
async function fetchWithRetry(url, apiKey, maxRetries = 3) {
  for (let attempt = 0; attempt <= maxRetries; attempt++) {
    const response = await fetch(url, {
      headers: { Authorization: `Basic ${btoa(`${apiKey}:`)}` }
    });

    if (response.status !== 429) return response;

    const delay = Math.pow(2, attempt) * 1000; // 1s, 2s, 4s
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, delay));
  }

  throw new Error("Rate limit exceeded after retries");
}
```

```python Python
import requests
import time

def fetch_with_retry(url, api_key, max_retries=3):
    for attempt in range(max_retries + 1):
        response = requests.get(url, auth=(api_key, ""))

        if response.status_code != 429:
            return response

        delay = 2 ** attempt  # 1s, 2s, 4s
        time.sleep(delay)

    raise Exception("Rate limit exceeded after retries")
```

</CodeGroup>

## Best practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use exponential backoff for retries">
    When retrying after a `429` or `5xx` error, increase the delay between attempts exponentially (e.g., 1s, 2s, 4s). This prevents overwhelming the API during high-traffic periods.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Only retry on appropriate status codes">
    Retry on `429` (rate limit) and `5xx` (server errors). Do **not** retry `400` (bad request) or `401` (unauthorized) — these require fixing the request itself.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Validate parameters before sending">
    Check that `page[size]` is between 1–100, timestamps are 13-digit milliseconds, and chain IDs match the [supported chains](/supported-blockchains). This avoids unnecessary `400` errors.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use webhooks instead of polling">
    If you need to monitor wallet activity, use [transaction subscriptions](/quickstart#4-subscribe-to-real-time-webhooks) instead of polling the transactions endpoint. This reduces your API usage and gives you faster notifications.
  </Accordion>
