Zerion API gives developers a single, normalized interface to access wallet-level blockchain data across all major EVM chains and Solana. Our mission is to make onchain data as easy to use as any traditional API — no nodes to manage, no chain-specific parsing, no raw logs to decode. Just clean, interpreted financial data ready to power your application.
