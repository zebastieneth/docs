title: "Introduction"
description: "A high-performance API for onchain data. Zerion delivers fast, normalized wallet and DeFi data across EVM chains and Solana, powering reliable apps from day one to global scale."
---

Zerion API is a single, normalized interface for wallet-level blockchain data across 15+ EVM chains and Solana. Instead of raw chain data, you get interpreted financial information — values, types, relationships, and metadata in a ready-to-use, human-readable format.

Battle-tested in production by consumer applications serving millions of users, the API delivers fresh data within milliseconds of new blocks hitting the chain.
