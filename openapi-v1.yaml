            This parameter allows to customize the aggregation of DeFi positions within a portfolio based on their types. The aggregation can include:

              - `only_simple`: Only includes wallet-type positions, which are basic, non-protocol related assets. This is the default selection if the parameter is not specified.
              - `only_complex`: Aggregates positions associated with DeFi protocols only (e.g., staked assets, liquidity pools), like Uniswap or Aave, excluding simple wallet positions.
              - `no_filter`: Provides an aggregated view of both protocol-related and simple wallet positions without any filtering.

            The selection of filters affects the composition of the aggregated portfolio results, allowing for tailored analysis and reporting based on the types of positions of interest.

        This endpoint returns a list of wallet positions.

        This endpoint supports testnets. To get data for testnets use `X-Env` header.

        **Understanding Liquidity Pool Positions:**

        Liquidity pools (Uniswap, Curve, Balancer, etc.) return **multiple positions** - one for each token in the pool. Positions belonging to the same pool share the same `group_id` value in attributes.

        For example, a Uniswap V2 USDC/WETH pool returns two positions:
        - Position 1: WETH token, `group_id="820ee2f1ca8ccb716f6beb5e450908a028be890ec44aba87c739b416ef41e197"`, `fungible_info.symbol="WETH"`
        - Position 2: USDC token, `group_id="820ee2f1ca8ccb716f6beb5e450908a028be890ec44aba87c739b416ef41e197"`, `fungible_info.symbol="USDC"`

        To display all tokens in a liquidity pool together, group positions by their `group_id` attribute.

        **Temporary limitations for Solana addresses:**
        - Doesn't support protocol positions

        This endpoint returns a list of transactions associated with the wallet.

        This endpoint supports testnets. To get data for testnets use `X-Env` header.

        **Temporary limitations for Solana addresses:**
        - Doesn't support NFT transactions

        > NOTE: This endpoint supports a lot of filters, sorting, and pagination parameters. Make sure that your request URL length is safe for your platform. Usually, 2000 characters are the safe limit in virtually any combination of client and server software.

        > NOTE: Consider all IDs as abstract strings, without making any assumptions about their format or relying on such assumptions. There is a non-zero probability that IDs may change in the future, and this should not result in any breaking changes.

      summary: Get a list of a wallet's NFT positions
      description: |
        This endpoint returns a list of the NFT positions held by a specific wallet.

        This endpoint supports testnets. To get data for testnets use `X-Env` header.

        If the wallet address has not been previously added, this endpoint may return a `202` status code. This indicates that the wallet's positions are not yet available, but will be in the near future. In this case, the client should periodically request this endpoint until a `200` status code is returned.

        > NOTE: It is important to stop retrying after a reasonable period of time. If a `200` status code is not returned within 2 minutes, it is likely that an unexpected error has occurred and the client should stop polling.

        > NOTE: This endpoint provides support for filters, sorting, and pagination parameters. Ensure that the length of the request URL falls within a safe range for your platform. Typically, a length of 2000 characters is a safe limit for most combinations of client and server software.

        > NOTE: Consider all IDs as abstract strings, without making any assumptions about their format or relying on such assumptions. There is a non-zero probability that IDs may change in the future, and this should not result in any breaking changes.

      summary: Get a list of NFT collections held by a wallet
      description: |
        This endpoint returns a list of the NFT collections held by a specific wallet.

        This endpoint supports testnets. To get data for testnets use `X-Env` header.

        If the wallet address has not been previously added, this endpoint may return a `202` status code. This indicates that the wallet's collections are not yet available, but will be in the near future. In this case, the client should periodically request this endpoint until a `200` status code is returned.

        > NOTE: It is important to stop retrying after a reasonable period of time. If a `200` status code is not returned within 2 minutes, it is likely that an unexpected error has occurred, and the client should stop polling.

        > NOTE: This endpoint provides support for filters, sorting. Ensure that the length of the request URL falls within a safe range for your platform. Typically, a length of 2000 characters is a safe limit for most combinations of client and server software.

        > NOTE: Consider all IDs as abstract strings, without making any assumptions about their format or relying on such assumptions. There is a non-zero probability that IDs may change in the future, and this should not result in any breaking changes.

        This endpoint returns the NFT portfolio overview of a web3 wallet.

        This endpoint supports testnets. To get data for testnets use `X-Env` header.

        If the address was not added before it is possible that this endpoint will return `202` status. It means that portfolio for the wallet is not prepared yet, but will be available soon. In that case the client have to request this endpoint periodically, while `200` status wasn't returned.

        > NOTE: Don't forget to stop retries after some reasonable period of time. If the `200` status is not returned within 2 minutes it most probably means that some unexpected error occurred and the client should stop the polling.

      description: |
        This endpoint returns a paginated list of fungible assets supported by Zerion. It also provides the ability to search for fungibles. 
        If no fungible assets are found for given filters, the empty list with 200 status is returned.

        > NOTE: This endpoint supports a lot of filters, sorting, and pagination parameters. Ensure your request URL length is within a safe range for your platform. Usually, 2000 characters are the safe limit in virtually any combination of client and server software.

        > NOTE: The `filter[implementation_address]` parameter ignores `filter[search_query]`. It may be changed in the future.

        > NOTE: Consider all IDs as abstract strings, without making any assumptions about their format or relying on such assumptions. There is a non-zero probability that IDs may change in the future, and this should not result in any breaking changes.

If nothing specified then `both` is used.'

      description: 'The endpoint offers a comprehensive overview of relevant trades and bridge exchanges. A bridge exchange refers to the transfer of cryptocurrencies between different blockchain networks, while a trade pertains to an exchange of cryptocurrencies within the same network. In an effort to secure the optimal exchange rate for our users, our system sends requests to multiple exchange providers. Zerion only charges a commission fee of 0.5% on L2 and alternative L1 trades, which can be waived by obtaining our Genesis NFT. Our platform has the advantage of being an aggregator of various exchanges, ensuring that users will always get the best exchange rates available. Please note that due to the nature of the multiple requests and calculations involved, it is normal for this endpoint to have a relatively long timeout. You can expect a response time of around 5-10 seconds.'

        ### Use Case
        The main use case for the webhooks system is to send notifications, similar to push notifications in the Zerion App.

        ### Setup Callback URL
        If you want to use this endpoint to test how it works, you might use your dev key to start. It has limits: one subscription & maximum 5 wallets per subscription.
        You may use callback URL from webhook.site to start from. If want use your custom - contact us at api@zerion.io, and we will whitelist your URL.

        If you want to use this endpoint in your production environment, you should contact us and provide the following details:
        - Your email associated with the API key
        - The URL that you prefer using as the callback (or host).

        After we've whitelisted your callback URL (or host), you may start using this endpoint.  

        ### Note
        - **Subscription Validity**: Every subscription is valid for unlimited amount of time for production key, and one week for `dev` keys.
        - **Transaction Prices**: Prices are not attached to webhook notifications and will always be `null`. Prices are added to transactions in the backend after some time. To get prices, query the transactions endpoint by hash.
        - **Delivery Guarantees**: Webhook delivery is not guaranteed. If delivery fails three times, no further attempts will be made.
        - **Order of Dispatch**: The order of webhook dispatch is not guaranteed and may not correspond to the order of transactions occurring on the blockchain.

        ### Callback Format and Signature Verification
        Approved clients will receive notifications via POST requests to their provided URL. These notifications will include a signed notification object in the body (specified below in the `Callback` section) and a signature in the headers.

        Clients should verify the signature provided in the headers of the webhook request to ensure the authenticity of the data. The following headers will be included:
        - `X-Signature`: The signature of the request.
        - `X-Timestamp`: The timestamp of the request.
        - `X-Certificate-URL`: The URL to download the public certificate used to verify the signature.

        **To verify the signature:**
        1. Concatenate the `X-Timestamp` header value, the request body, and a newline character: `$timestamp + "\n" + $request.body + "\n"`
        2. Use the public certificate downloaded from the `X-Certificate-URL` header to verify the signature in the `X-Signature` header.

        Example code in go for message verification:

        ```go
        package signature

        import (
          "crypto"
          "crypto/rsa"
          "crypto/sha256"
          "crypto/x509"
          "encoding/base64"
          "encoding/pem"
          "errors"
          "github.com/stretchr/testify/assert"
          "testing"
        )

        // FetchCertificate fetches the certificate from the given URL
        func FetchCertificate() (*x509.Certificate, error) {
          certBytes := certificate()
          block, _ := pem.Decode(certBytes)
          if block == nil || block.Type != "CERTIFICATE" {
            return nil, errors.New("failed to decode PEM block containing the certificate")
          }

          return x509.ParseCertificate(block.Bytes)
        }
