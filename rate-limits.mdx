Rate limits depend on your plan. Visit the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.zerion.io) for your current limits and upgrade options.

## Monitoring usage

Check the `X-RateLimit-*` headers in every API response to track your consumption in real time.

## When you hit the limit

The API returns a `429 Too Many Requests` response:

```json
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "title": "Too many requests",
      "detail": "Your request had been throttled"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Handling rate limits

Use exponential backoff to retry after a `429` response:

<CodeGroup>

```javascript JavaScript
async function fetchWithRetry(url, apiKey, maxRetries = 3) {
  for (let attempt = 0; attempt <= maxRetries; attempt++) {
    const response = await fetch(url, {
      headers: { Authorization: `Basic ${btoa(`${apiKey}:`)}` }
    });

    if (response.status !== 429) return response;

    const delay = Math.pow(2, attempt) * 1000; // 1s, 2s, 4s
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, delay));
  }

  throw new Error("Rate limit exceeded after retries");
}
```

```python Python
import requests
import time

def fetch_with_retry(url, api_key, max_retries=3):
    for attempt in range(max_retries + 1):
        response = requests.get(url, auth=(api_key, ""))

        if response.status_code != 429:
            return response

        delay = 2 ** attempt  # 1s, 2s, 4s
        time.sleep(delay)

    raise Exception("Rate limit exceeded after retries")
```

</CodeGroup>

## Tips to stay under the limit

- **Use webhooks instead of polling** — [transaction subscriptions](/api-reference/tx-subscriptions/create-subscription-wallet-transactions) give you real-time updates without repeated requests
- **Cache responses** where data doesn't change frequently (e.g., chain lists, token metadata)
- **Use filters and pagination** to fetch only the data you need — smaller requests, fewer calls
