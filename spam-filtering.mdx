title: "Spam Filtering"
description: "How Zerion detects and filters spam tokens across positions and transactions."
---

Zerion's API includes a built-in spam detection system that flags low-quality or deceptive assets using the `is_trash` flag. This lets you filter out spam tokens across endpoints like `/positions` and `/transactions` without building your own detection logic.

## How it works

The spam detection system uses multiple layers:

- **Heuristics** — Analysis of on-chain behaviors including mass airdrops, impersonation of popular assets (e.g., mimicking name/symbol), and suspicious transfer patterns.
- **External intelligence** — Multiple third-party data providers to assess token quality.
- **Community feedback** — Users and partners can report false positives or unflagged spam for review.
- **Internal rules** — Proprietary logic applied across the system to ensure consistent filtering across APIs and frontend views.

## Using the `filter[trash]` parameter

The `filter[trash]` parameter controls spam filtering on supported endpoints:

| Value | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `only_non_trash` | Only return non-spam assets (hides spam) |
| `only_trash` | Only return spam assets |
| `no_filter` | Return everything, spam included |

### Default behavior

<Note>
Defaults differ by endpoint:
- **Positions**: defaults to `only_non_trash` (spam hidden)
- **Transactions**: defaults to `no_filter` (spam included)
</Note>

### Examples

```bash
# Get positions with spam hidden (default)
curl -u "YOUR_API_KEY:" \
  "https://api.zerion.io/v1/wallets/0xd8dA.../positions/?filter[trash]=only_non_trash"

# Get only spam tokens
curl -u "YOUR_API_KEY:" \
  "https://api.zerion.io/v1/wallets/0xd8dA.../positions/?filter[trash]=only_trash"

# Get everything including spam
curl -u "YOUR_API_KEY:" \
  "https://api.zerion.io/v1/wallets/0xd8dA.../positions/?filter[trash]=no_filter"
```

## Reporting misclassifications

If you notice an asset that's incorrectly flagged or missing a flag, reach out via the support chat or email us at [api@zerion.io](mailto:api@zerion.io). We actively refine the filter based on evolving behavior and ecosystem feedback.
